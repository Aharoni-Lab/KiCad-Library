# KiCad-Library

KiCad-Library holds the schematics and footprints for all components used in the Aharoni Lab.

## Getting Started

Clone KiCad-Library to your local computer. We suggest placing it in "documents/KiCad/" where it will be along side your other user created files. You will then need to add the schematic and footprint library paths to KiCad. We suggest configuring a new path as something like "KICAD_AHARONI_LAB" with the path to the location to this repo an then using "KICAD_AHARONI_LAB" for each library path.

### Prerequisites

You will need [KiCad v5.x](http://kicad-pcb.org/) to use these libraries. We also suggest getting the free lite version of [PCB Library Expert](http://www.pcblibraries.com/LibraryExpert/) to generate new footprints to be added to this library.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
